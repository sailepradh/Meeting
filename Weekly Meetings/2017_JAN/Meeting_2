#### Individual Updates
   Today we had general introduction of lab members and projects we are involved in.
  
___
#### Project infomation

###### Tobias Everhorn

* Genral aim is to understand non coding regulatory variants involved in arthesclerosis
* THP1 —> relevant celltype
* THP1+LPS —> to understand innate immune sytem activated and see how regulatory netwrok is rewired with addition of LPS.
* RNA data in response to LPS
* HiCap data to see regularoy network enriched withLPS pathway

###### Anil Anandashankar

*  analyze Hi-Ca data with different parameters optimization

###### Ayla De Paepe

* 4 patients with rare form condition
* Hypothesis: possible interaction of non coding variants

###### Sailendra Pradhananga

* Eczema —> complex disease—> over hundred GWAS study
* HiCap and RNA data on keratinocytes
* Observe target genes that are associated with variants 

###### Pontus Höjer

* Blood cancer —> CGH array (low resolution)
* Detect SNP and relevant genes 
* Closer to clinical usages


###### Mona 

* Aim: Identify gremline mutation that would cause high and low toxicity in lung cancer patients
* 3 relevant cell type and treated with drugs (before and after)
* Hi-Cap probe set from prioritizing WGS variants 

###### Rapolas Spalinskas

* Interaction between different zygosity of an genome
* Celline with most epigenetic data 


___
### Connecting themes
 
 * Non coding regulatory variants in differnt complex disease
 * Robust version of HiCap data analysis
