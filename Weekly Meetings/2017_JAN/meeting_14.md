___
#### Individual Updates


###### Pontus Höjer

* New method for barcoding and seem to works
* done with some tested genome work with trimethylation
* Droplet phase from crosslinked complex 
* k3 trimethylation --> next phase 

######  Tobias Everhorn

* Hi-CAP B cell analysis have been processed 
* Estimation of sequcing depth; probabbly not expensive
* Needed to do BAU and TADS in replicates 
* Further discussion on HiCAP data

######  Rapolas Spalinskas 

* Good news : Tested the locii that are interacting with mirs. 
* Apparently have binding capacity so could have regulatory effect
* Worked on GM12878 but have to tested for other 
* Establishment of method at cardiovascular group in KI



###### Sailendra Pradhananga

* Worked with the probe set for all new files
* 70,000 odd probe sequences were found 
* Somehow we have to select at 50,000+ only
* Aim to design probes by the end of this week  


######  Örjan Åkerborg

* Worked with HiCAP paper and responded reviwers comments: 
* Comparison with established method
* Inital result --> they were better than shorter distance in 50kb and better in larger groups
* Far better in longer ranges 500kb+ 
* Supplementary table and paper is done and resubmission of the paper
* Hopeful for the paper to be accpeted.
