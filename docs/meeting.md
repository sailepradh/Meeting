### Meeting Notes

#### Aim
 * Update on individual project
 * Coordinate and collaborate between differnt projects 
 
#### Format
  * Roughly 1 hour depending upon time and personels
  * Five minute each for all the partcipants 
  * More focus on discusssion rather than informting about projects
  * General idea listen and get involved although everything does not make sense
___

#### Individual Updates
   Today we had general introduction of lab members and projects we are involved in.
  
___
#### Project infomation

###### Project1: Cardiovascular non coding regulatory variants

* Genral aim is to understand non coding regulatory variants involved in arthesclerosis
* THP1 —> relevant celltype
* THP1+LPS —> to understand innate immune sytem activated and see how regulatory netwrok is rewired with addition of LPS.
* RNA data in response to LPS
* HiCap data to see regularoy network enriched withLPS pathway

###### Project2: Analysis pipeline for HI-Cap data analysis

*  analyze Hi-Ca data with different parameters optimization

###### Project3: Rare form atherosclerosis

* 4 patients with rare form condition
* Hypothesis: possible interaction of non coding variants

###### Project4: Eczema project 

* Ezema —> complex disease—> over hundred GWAS study
* HiCap and RNA data on keratinocytes
* Observe target genes that are associated with variants 

###### Project5: ALL project + Clinicians

* Blood cancer —> CGH array (low resolution)
* Detect SNP and relevant genes 
* Closer to clinical usages


###### Project6: Lung Cancer toxicity project

* Aim: Identify gremline mutation that would cause high and low toxicity in lung cancer patients
* 3 relevant cell type and treated with drugs (before and after)
* Hi-Cap probe set from prioritizing WGS variants 

###### Project7:GM12878 cell line

* Interaction between different zygosity of an genome
* Celline with most epigenetic data 

###### Project8: Ligation-free method development

* Aim: Enable complex resolution of epigentic data

___
### Connecting themes
 
 * Non coding regulatory variants in differnt complex disease
 * Robust version of HiCap data analysis
